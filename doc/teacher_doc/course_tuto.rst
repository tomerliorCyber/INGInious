Tutorial
--------

Creating courses is reserved to the super-administrators (See :ref:`ConfigReference`). Course administrators are then
able to configure the course by themselves.

.. note::

    Demonstration tasks are made available for download on the `INGInious-demo-tasks repository <https://github.com/UCL-INGI/INGInious-demo-tasks>`_. They
    can also be downloaded and installed automatically via the :ref:`inginious-install` script. You can also download courses examples on the marketplace page which allows to easily import courses files. The list of these open source courses is also available on the `INGInious-course repository <https://github.com/UCL-INGI/INGInious-courses>`_

Using the webapp :

#. As a super-administrator, go to the bottom of the *My course list* page and enter a new course id, for
   instance ``demo``,and click on *Create new course*. A newly created hidden  course named *demo* appears
   on the list.
#. Click on that course, and then on *Course administration* in the sidebar to change the course parameters,
   add course administrators and tasks.
