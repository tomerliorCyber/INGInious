INGIniousÂ is an intelligent grader that allows secured and automated testing of code made by students.

It is written in Python and uses Docker_ to run student's code inside a secured environment.

INGInious provides a backend which manages interaction with Docker and grade code, and a frontend which allows students to submit their code in a simple and beautiful interface. The frontend also includes a simple administration interface that allows teachers to check the progression of their students and to modify exercices in a simple way.

The backend is independent of the frontend and was made to be used as a library.

INGInious can be used as an external grader for EDX. The course `Paradigms of Computer Programming - Fundamentals`_ uses INGInious to correct students' code.
